# TwoWholeWorms/TwwDoctrineFreeTds

This repo contains a Doctrine2 driver for SQL Server which uses FreeTDS to connect to the server. It was written to connect a
ZF2 project I maintain to SQL Server databases as Doctrine2 doesn't natively support PDO ODBC connections.

As always, install with composer:

 php composer.phar require twowholeworms/tww-doctrine-freetds dev-devel
